# neuro_code
Neuro_code is a repository created to collect all the necessary tools to allow the analysis of neural and kinematic data in a research environment.

There are plenty of similar tools out there. However, in contrast to most currently available tools, this repository implements state-of-art machine learning approaches to detect gait states from neural data.
Though you might find some scientific papers which use machine learning approaches, their methods are... you know... "conveniently" explained.

However, open-science is the future and I am happy to share my code with you all.
Enjoy!
